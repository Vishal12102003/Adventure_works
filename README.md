## ðŸš€ Steps Followed

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Data Import
- Loaded the `.xlsx` dataset into **Excel** for initial review.
- Then imported into **Power BI** via **Power Query Editor**.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Data Profiling in Power Query
- Enabled the following options in the **View** tab:
  - `Column distribution`
  - `Column quality`
  - `Column profile`
- Changed profiling mode to:  
  âœ… **Column profiling based on entire dataset**

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Data Transformation
- **Appended** `Fact_Internet_Sales_New` to `FactInternetSales` â†’ named the resulting table: `Sales`.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Data Enrichment via Lookups
Performed multiple **lookup operations** to bring in relevant details:
- `ProductName` from the **Product** table to **Sales**
- `CustomerFullName` from the **Customer** table to **Sales**
- `Unit Price` from **Product** table to **Sales**

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Date Table and Time Intelligence
Created a **Date dimension** from the `OrderDateKey` and generated the following fields:

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Year` | Extracted using `YEAR([OrderDateKey])` |
| `MonthNo` | `FORMAT([OrderDateKey], "mm")` |
| `MonthName` | `FORMAT([OrderDateKey], "mmmm")` |
| `Quarter` | `CONCATENATE("Q", QUARTER([OrderDateKey]))` |
| `WeekdayNo` | `WEEKNUM([OrderDateKey])` |
| `WeekdayName` | `FORMAT([OrderDateKey], "DDDD")` |
| `FinancialMonth` | Custom fiscal month calculation |
| `FinancialYear` | Custom fiscal year calculation |

### Fiscal Logic:
```DAX
FinancialMonth = IF(MONTH([OrderDateKey]) >= 4, MONTH([OrderDateKey]) - 3, MONTH([OrderDateKey]) + 9)

FinancialYear = IF(MONTH([OrderDateKey]) >= 4, YEAR([OrderDateKey]), YEAR([OrderDateKey]) - 1)

SalesAmt = [UnitPrice] * [OrderQuantity] - [UnitPriceDiscountPct]

ProductionCost = [ProductStandardCost] * [OrderQuantity]

Profit = [SalesAmt] - [ProductionCost]

```
